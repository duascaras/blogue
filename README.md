# Django Overview

- Follows the MTV (Model-Template-View) pattern.

- Similar to MVC, where the template acts as the view and the framework itself as the controller.

- Model: Logical data structure and is the data handler between the database and the view.

- View: Communicates with the database via the model and transfer data to the template for viewing. 

- Template: Presentation layer, using a plain-text system that keeps everything that the browser renders.
